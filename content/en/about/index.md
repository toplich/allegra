Welcome to **Allegra** – a non-profit initiative in Switzerland that promotes integration through real human connection.

Our goal is to organize **clubs and creative studios**, where locals and newcomers meet regularly, share experiences, and learn from each other.

Whether it's photography, language exchange, board games, or cooking – our gatherings create space for dialogue, creativity, and mutual respect.

We believe that integration doesn't start with paperwork, but with a smile and an open mind.

**Join us – be part of the community!**
