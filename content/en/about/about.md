## Who we are

**Allegra March** is a non-profit association composed of volunteers from different countries and cultures. Our goal is to promote community and cultural exchange, thus facilitating integration and inclusion in Switzerland.

Our offer is aimed at all residents of the **March** district – whether local or newly arrived.

## Our concept

> _"This project thrives on the diverse participation of everyone."_  
> – Guiding principle of the association

In various **Ateliers**, interested individuals come together to spend their free time in meaningful ways.

🧵 An overview and registration for each Atelier can be found under [**Ateliers**]({{< relref "/atelier/_index.md" >}}).  
🤝 If you would like to offer an Atelier yourself, we look forward to your [**message**]({{< relref "/contact/" >}}).

## Creating together

Every few months, all interested people gather in a **plenum**  
to present what has been created in the Ateliers  
and to introduce new ideas and initiatives.

🗓 The various dates can be found in the [**Agenda**]({{< relref "/notices/agenda/_index.md" >}}).
