**We say thank you!**

We would like to thank all the dedicated volunteers of the Allegra March association, as well as everyone who leads Ateliers and organizes Info-Point events.

A special thanks goes to Komin for their support in launching our association, their committed assistance in our work, and their valuable role as a point of contact.

And last but not least, we thank all the participants of the Ateliers and Info-Point events. With you, we can bring integration and inclusion to life.
